## How It Works

1. **HealthKit Integration**: The app reads your sleep data from the Health app
2. **Sleep Bank Calculation**: Compares your actual sleep to your goal over a configurable period
3. **Smart Recommendations**: Suggests bedtime based on your sleep debt/credit and wake time
4. **Visual Feedback**: Clear indicators of your sleep status and progress

## Requirements

- iOS 17.0+
- HealthKit access
- Sleep data recorded in the Health app

## Setup

1. Open the project in Xcode
2. Build and run on a device (HealthKit requires a physical device)
3. Grant HealthKit permissions when prompted
4. Configure your sleep goal and wake time in settings

## Privacy

- All data stays on your device
- No data is sent to external servers
- HealthKit data is only read, never written to

## Architecture

- **SwiftUI**: Modern declarative UI framework
- **SwiftData**: Local data persistence for user preferences
- **HealthKit**: Sleep data integration
- **MVVM Pattern**: Clean separation of concerns

The app follows iOS design guidelines and provides a clean, intuitive interface for sleep optimization.
